# CNN-dog-app
CNN dog identifier

The goal of this project was to develop a function that would identify if an image was of a dog or a person's face.  If it found a dog, it would return the dog's breed.  If it found a human face, it would return the breed of dog that most closely resembled that person.

For this project, the following algorithms were built or investigated
1. Facial recognition algorithms
2. A CNN to identify the breed of the dog
3. VGG16
4. Resnet50 and a model built on Resnet50 using transfer learning

This project is from Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Program.
